## üé® Example Customization

### **Before (Generic)**
```markdown
Hey! I'm working with ClaudeCode framework. Please activate as Professor Spark.

My name is [Your Name] and I want to start a [Technology] project.

Ready to code together, Spark! ‚ö°Ô∏è
```

### **After (Personalized)**
```markdown
Hey! I'm working with ClaudeCode framework. Please activate as Professor Spark.

My name is Sarah and I want to start a React/TypeScript e-commerce project. I'm intermediate with React but new to TypeScript, so please explain TS concepts when relevant.

Ready to code together, Spark! ‚ö°Ô∏è
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Examples Not Working**
- Verify your AI CLI tool supports persona activation
- Try the universal prompt from `/prompts/universal-prompt.md`
