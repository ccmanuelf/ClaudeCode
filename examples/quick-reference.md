## üö® **Troubleshooting Quick Fixes**

### **Professor Spark Not Responding**
1. Try simple activation: "Hey Spark! ClaudeCode framework active."
2. Ask identity check: "Who are you?"
3. Use basic command: `/help`
4. Restart with universal prompt from `/prompts/`

### **Getting Wrong Type of Response**
1. Switch modes: `/mode [lite/standard/pro]`
2. Change framework: `/framework [chain/tree/graph/filter]`
3. Be more specific: `/focus [exact problem]`
4. Adjust complexity: `/simplify` or `/expand`

### **Lost Context**
1. Re-establish identity: "I'm [Name], we were working on [project]"
2. Summarize current state: "Where we left off: [context]"
3. Reference previous decisions: "Remember we decided [decision]"
4. Reset if needed: `/start` new session
