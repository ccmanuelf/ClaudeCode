# Professor Spark ⚡️ Subsystem PRD

## Overview

Professor Spark is an adaptive, reasoning-driven persona engineered to guide users through analytical decision-making, cognitive exploration, and code-adjacent planning tasks. Spark applies multiple frameworks to match complexity levels and user preferences, supported by tool prioritization and strict reasoning discipline.

## Objectives

- Enable multi-modal reasoning using Chain, Tree, Graph, and Filtration frameworks  
- Guide task planning, PRD breakdowns, and technical analysis with conversational clarity  
- Enforce behavioral guardrails for verbosity, emoji syntax, tool usage, and output limits  
- Support progressive onboarding with modular prompt scaffolds and command registry

## Core Capabilities

- Mode-aware reasoning (`lite`, `standard`, `pro`)  
- Framework orchestration with lazy loading and confidence scoring  
- Conversational planning via reusable prompt sets  
- Resilient response management for platform limitations

### 3. System Modules

| File                                | Role                                   |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `persona/professor_spark.md`        | Defines Spark’s traits, tone, and commands  
| `prompts/questions_framework.md`    | Inquiry scaffold: investigation → reflection  
| `prompts/task_planning_phrases.md` | Conversational task breakdown phrasing  
| `behavior_modules/framework_orchestration.md` | Manages framework selection and mode state  
| `behavior_modules/tool_usage_prioritization.md` | Guides strategic tool use  
| `guardrails/mode_behavior_control.md` | Emoji usage, verbosity, mode enforcement  
| `guardrails/response_length_control.md` | Output size, chunking, retry protocol  
| `templates/analysis_framework_selector.json` | Trigger-to-framework mapping for automation  

## Development Milestones

- ✅ Framework design complete  
- ✅ Prompt structures deployed  
- ✅ Guardrails and behaviors modularized  
- 🔜 Workflow integration and config.yaml bindings  
- 🔜 Evaluation harness for framework selection accuracy  

## Technical Considerations

- All framework outputs must declare selected reasoning mode, emoji tags, and confidence score  
- Response splitting must follow chunk and pagination guidelines  
- Tool usage must route through prioritization map and fallback logic  
- Verbosity enforcement must align with user preference and guardrail thresholds  

## Future Expansion

- Multi-agent handoff protocol between Spark and coding assistants  
- Visualization layer: render Tree/Graph reasoning flows  
- Framework-specific caching and analysis history review  
- Framework extender plugins (e.g., analogical reasoning, probabilistic graphs)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Spark greets users using lite mode with emoji-driven prompts  
- [ ] Framework output includes proper emoji tags, reasoning trail, and mode declaration  
- [ ] Tasks and PRDs reflect tone and planning strategy from Spark prompts  
- [ ] Response truncation is handled with chunking or fallback retry  
- [ ] Tool usage follows selection map and avoids redundancy
