# Testing Coverage Requirements Guardrail

## Overview
This guardrail ensures that all development work maintains high-quality testing standards with comprehensive coverage requirements throughout the ClaudeCode development process.

## Core Requirements

### **Minimum Coverage Thresholds**
- **Unit Tests**: 90% line coverage minimum
- **Integration Tests**: 80% feature coverage minimum  
- **End-to-End Tests**: 100% critical path coverage
- **API Tests**: 95% endpoint coverage minimum

### **Test Types Required**

#### **Unit Testing**
- All functions must have corresponding unit tests
- Edge cases and error conditions must be tested
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Test both positive and negative scenarios

#### **Integration Testing**
- Test component interactions
- Validate data flow between modules
- Test configuration loading and validation
- Verify checkpoint and recovery systems

#### **System Testing**
- End-to-end workflow validation
- Performance under load
- Error recovery scenarios
- Configuration edge cases

## Implementation Standards

### **Test Organization**
```
tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── test_config_validator.py
│   ├── test_progress_manager.py
│   └── test_checkpoint_system.py
├── integration/
│   ├── test_resume_workflow.py
│   └── test_validation_integration.py
└── e2e/
    ├── test_complete_workflows.py
    └── test_recovery_scenarios.py
```

### **Test Naming Conventions**
- Test files: `test_<module_name>.py`
- Test classes: `Test<ClassName>`
- Test methods: `test_<functionality>_<scenario>`

### **Documentation Requirements**
- Each test must have clear docstring explaining purpose
- Complex test setups must be documented
- Test data and fixtures must be explained

## Quality Gates

### **Pre-Commit Requirements**
1. All tests must pass
2. Coverage thresholds must be met
3. No test files can be committed with `@skip` decorators
4. Performance tests must meet baseline requirements

### **Code Review Checklist**
- [ ] New functionality includes comprehensive tests
- [ ] Edge cases are properly tested
- [ ] Error conditions are validated
- [ ] Performance implications are tested
- [ ] Documentation is updated

### **Continuous Integration**
- Tests run on every commit
- Coverage reports generated automatically
- Performance regression detection
- Flaky test identification and remediation

## Test Data Management

### **Test Fixtures**
- Use consistent test data across test suites
- Isolate test data from production configurations
- Clean up test artifacts after execution
- Version control test data changes

### **Mock Strategy**
- Mock external APIs and services
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Maintain mock data consistency
- Document mock behavior and limitations

## Performance Testing

### **Response Time Requirements**
- Configuration validation: < 500ms
- Progress state loading: < 200ms
- Checkpoint creation: < 1s
- Recovery operations: < 2s

### **Load Testing Standards**
- Support 100+ concurrent validation requests
- Handle 1000+ checkpoint operations per hour
- Maintain performance under memory constraints
- Graceful degradation under high load

## Error Handling Testing

### **Required Error Scenarios**
- Invalid configuration files
- Missing dependencies
- Corrupted checkpoint data
- Network failures
- File system errors
- Permission issues

### **Recovery Testing**
- Automatic recovery mechanisms
- Data integrity after failures
- User notification systems
- Fallback behavior validation

## Reporting and Metrics

### **Coverage Reports**
- Line coverage by module
- Branch coverage analysis
- Function coverage metrics
- Uncovered code identification

### **Test Metrics**
- Test execution time trends
- Flaky test identification
- Test maintenance overhead
- Coverage trend analysis

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### **Automated Checks**
- Pre-commit hooks for coverage validation
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Automated test generation suggestions
- Coverage regression prevention

### **Manual Reviews**
- Peer review of test quality
- Architecture review for testability
- Test strategy validation
- Knowledge sharing sessions

## Exceptions and Waivers

### **Temporary Waivers**
- Must be documented with justification
- Include timeline for remediation
- Require technical lead approval
- Regular review and cleanup

### **Legacy Code Handling**
- Phased coverage improvement plans
- Risk assessment for untested code
- Prioritized testing roadmap
- Documentation of testing gaps

## Tools and Frameworks

### **Recommended Testing Stack**
- **Unit Testing**: pytest, unittest
- **Coverage**: pytest-cov, coverage.py
- **Mocking**: unittest.mock, pytest-mock
- **Fixtures**: pytest fixtures, factory-boy
- **Performance**: pytest-benchmark, locust

### **CI/CD Integration**
- GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Coverage reporting to PR comments
- Performance regression detection
- Test result notifications

## Success Criteria

### **Project Health Indicators**
- Consistent high coverage (>90%)
- Low flaky test rate (<1%)
- Fast test execution (<5 minutes full suite)
- High developer confidence in changes

### **Quality Metrics**
- Reduced production defects
- Faster feature development cycles
- Improved code maintainability
- Enhanced system reliability
