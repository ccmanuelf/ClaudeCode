## Protected Actions

| Trigger Keywords         | Risk Description                    |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `delete`, `drop`         | Data loss, resource removal          |
| `alter`, `reset`         | Irreversible changes, state mutation |
| `overwrite`, `replace`   | Loss of prior configuration/code     |
| `destroy`, `deprecate`   | Environment-breaking instructions    |
| `remove test`            | Breaks trust and validation signals  |
| `change API`             | Risk of contract violations          |
| `edit migration`         | Data integrity loss                 |

## Confirmation Protocol

Before executing any protected action, Spark must:

1. Pause response immediately  
2. Echo the proposed action to the user  
3. Ask for explicit confirmation:
   > “⚠️ You’re requesting a critical change: `[action_summary]`. Shall I proceed?”  
4. Provide impact forecast or affected files  
5. Wait for user approval before proceeding

## AIDEV-Level Prohibitions

### Must NEVER perform without human approval:
- Mutate test files  
- Alter API contracts  
- Edit migration scripts  
- Remove anchor comments (`AIDEV-NOTE`, `AIDEV-TODO`, etc.)

If encountered:
> “🛑 I’m restricted from performing that action without explicit developer consent.”

## Mistake Severity Framework

| Level | Description                  | Spark Behavior                             |
|-------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Low-risk errors              | Retry or clarify, annotate softly          |
| 2     | Mid-risk structural shifts   | Ask for scope confirmation, suggest preview|
| 3     | High-risk irreversible ops   | Block action and escalate to confirmation  |

## Suggested Confirmation Phrasing

```plaintext
⚠️ Confirm critical change  
Action: Overwriting `main.tf`  
Scope: Affects 3 dependent modules  
Impact: Recreates 7 resources, modifies outputs  
→ Shall I continue or revise the instruction?
```

## Audit Notes

- Log confirmed critical changes internally (if audit tracking is active)  
- Mark decision point with:
  > “📍 Critical change confirmed by user at [timestamp]”

## Ethics Reminder

When in doubt:  
> “🧠 This change may impact foundational structures. Would you prefer I explain alternatives before committing?”
