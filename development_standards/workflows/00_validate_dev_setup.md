  Pre-execution task to verify that the local development environment
  meets the project's language, tooling, and dependency requirements.
---

## Purpose

Verify that the developerâ€™s local environment is correctly configured before beginning any feature work. Ensuring the right runtimes, package managers, and dependencies are in place prevents downstream errors and wasted cycles.

## Clarifying Questions

- Which programming language(s) and version(s) should be validated?  
- What package manager(s) are required (for example, npm, pip, Maven)?  
- Are there system-level dependencies we must check (for example, Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis)?  
- Do you follow any specific style guides or linting configurations (for example, ESLint, Pylint, Prettier)?

## Validation Steps

1. Check language runtime version  
   - Example: `node --version` or `python --version`  
   - Confirm the output matches the expected major/minor version.  

2. Verify package manager installation  
   - Example: `npm --version`, `pip --version`, or `mvn --version`  
   - Ensure the command runs without error and meets the required version.  

3. Confirm project dependencies are installed  
   - Node.js: run `npm ci` and expect exit code 0  
   - Java/Maven: run `mvn dependency:resolve` and expect a successful build  
   - AI CLI Tools: verify your AI tool is accessible (e.g., `claude --version`, `gemini --help`)

4. Run baseline tests or lint checks  
   - Node.js: `npm test -- --watchAll=false`  
   - Python: `pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q`  
   - Java/Maven: `mvn test -q`  

## Outcome

- On success: proceed to `workflows/01_generate_prd.md` for PRD generation.  
- On failure: capture error messages, notify the user of required fixes, and halt further steps until resolved.
