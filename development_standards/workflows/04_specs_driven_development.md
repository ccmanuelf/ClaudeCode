  Implements Specs-Driven Development methodology where formal specifications
  drive the entire development lifecycle, transforming AI from unpredictable
  generator into reliable engineering partner.
---

## Purpose

Establish a blueprint-first approach to development where detailed specifications serve as the single source of truth for both human developers and AI partners. This methodology transforms the developer's role from coder to architect.

## Core Philosophy

> "Imagine building a house without a blueprint. The foundation might be wrong, the walls might not align, and the final result would be chaotic and unpredictable."

Specs-Driven Development (SDD) creates that blueprint before any code is written, providing AI with clear, structured, and unambiguous specifications for reliable execution.

## The Three-Step SDD Process

### 1. Define the Spec
The developer's primary responsibility is analyzing problems and creating detailed task specifications.

**A complete spec must include:**
- **Clear Goal:** User story or objective definition
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Success conditions and completion markers  
- **Constraints & Edge Cases:** Boundaries and potential pitfalls
- **Implementation Notes:** Required patterns, libraries, or functions
- **Context Requirements:** Dependencies and integration points

### 2. AI Implementation
With a clear spec, delegate implementation to AI using structured commands:
- Load spec as primary context
- Execute implementation with `/do_task` or similar commands
- Focus AI entirely on translating requirements into code

### 3. Review and Refine
Review AI-generated output against the spec:
- **First Question:** "Is the spec clear enough?"
- **Refinement Process:** Update spec, regenerate code
- **Documentation Sync:** Spec remains source of truth

## Spec Template Structure

```markdown
# Task Specification: [TASK_NAME]

## Goal
[Clear, concise objective statement]

## User Story
As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit].

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2  
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Technical Requirements
### Must Have
- [Required functionality]

### Should Have  
- [Preferred functionality]

### Could Have
- [Optional enhancements]

## Constraints
- [Technical limitations]
- [Business rules]  
- [Performance requirements]

## Edge Cases
- [Boundary conditions]
- [Error scenarios]
- [Integration challenges]

## Implementation Notes
- [Specific patterns to use]
- [Libraries or frameworks]
- [Architecture decisions]

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

## Benefits of Spec-First Approach

### For AI Collaboration
- **Predictable Output:** Dramatically improves AI reliability and consistency
- **Reduced Ambiguity:** Eliminates guesswork and misinterpretation  
- **Focused Context:** Provides precise, relevant information

### For Development Process
- **Enhanced Developer Focus:** Frees developers for architecture and problem-solving
- **Living Documentation:** Specs become rich, up-to-date project history
- **Superior Testability:** Clear criteria foundation for robust testing

## Integration with ClaudeCode

### Workflow Triggers
- `/create_spec [task_name]` - Initialize new specification
- `/review_spec [spec_file]` - Validate specification completeness  
- `/implement_spec [spec_file]` - Execute AI implementation
- `/refine_spec [spec_file]` - Update based on implementation feedback

### File Organization
```
tasks/
├── specs/
│   ├── [task-name]-spec.md
│   └── [task-name]-implementation.md
└── completed/
    └── [task-name]-final.md
```

## Quality Gates

### Spec Completeness Checklist
- [ ] Goal clearly defined
- [ ] Acceptance criteria measurable
- [ ] Edge cases identified
- [ ] Implementation constraints specified
- [ ] Success metrics defined

### Implementation Validation
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Edge cases handled
- [ ] Tests cover requirements
- [ ] Documentation matches implementation

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small:** Begin with minimal viable specs, iterate
2. **Be Specific:** Avoid ambiguous language, use concrete examples
3. **Include Context:** Provide necessary background information
4. **Validate Early:** Review specs before implementation begins
5. **Iterate Thoughtfully:** Refine specs based on implementation learnings

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Vague Requirements:** "Make it better" or "Fix the issues"
- **Implementation Details in Specs:** Focus on what, not how
- **Spec Drift:** Changing requirements without updating specs
- **Skip Validation:** Implementing without reviewing spec completeness

## Success Metrics

- **Spec Quality:** Percentage of specs requiring < 2 iterations
- **Implementation Accuracy:** AI output meeting acceptance criteria first time
- **Documentation Sync:** Specs and implementation remaining aligned
- **Development Speed:** Time from spec completion to implementation
