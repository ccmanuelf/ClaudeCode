  Comprehensive workflow for integrating existing project documentation,
  requirements, specifications, and design documents into ClaudeCode
  project structure for optimal AI-assisted development.
---

## Purpose

Establish a systematic approach for integrating existing project documentation into ClaudeCode projects, ensuring that all available project knowledge is properly organized, accessible, and actionable for AI-assisted development workflows.

## Core Integration Philosophy

> "Every piece of project knowledge should be discoverable, contextual, and actionable"

This workflow treats existing documentation as valuable project assets that need to be organized, analyzed, and integrated into the development process rather than simply stored as reference materials.

   - Assess document quality and currency
   - Note any missing critical documentation

2. **Categorize by Type**
   - Business requirements and specifications
   - Technical architecture and design
   - User experience and interface design
   - Project management and planning
   - Legacy system documentation

3. **Evaluate Document Quality**
   - Completeness of information
   - Currency and relevance
   - Clarity and actionability
   - Conflicts or inconsistencies
```

#### Step 2: Gap Analysis
```markdown
1. **Identify Information Gaps**
   - Missing requirements or specifications
   - Incomplete technical documentation
   - Unclear business rules or logic
   - Missing integration requirements

2. **Prioritize Documentation Needs**
   - Critical missing information
   - Nice-to-have additional details
   - Future documentation requirements
   - Maintenance and update needs

3. **Plan Documentation Creation**
   - Documents that need to be created
   - Existing documents that need updates
   - Documentation standards to establish
   - Review and approval processes
```

### Phase 2: Document Processing & Organization

#### Step 1: File Organization
```bash
# Create documentation structure
mkdir -p docs/{requirements,technical,design,management,legacy}
mkdir -p docs/requirements/{business,functional,non-functional,user-stories,stakeholders}
mkdir -p docs/technical/{architecture,api,database,integration,security,performance}
mkdir -p docs/design/{mockups,wireframes,style-guides,user-journeys,accessibility}
mkdir -p docs/management/{plans,risks,resources,timeline,budget}
mkdir -p docs/legacy/{systems,migration,data-mapping,integration,deprecation}
```

#### Step 2: Document Processing
```markdown
1. **Convert to Standard Formats**
   - Convert Word documents to Markdown where appropriate
   - Extract text from PDFs for searchability
   - Convert images to web-friendly formats
   - Standardize naming conventions

2. **Create Document Index**
   - Generate comprehensive document catalog
   - Create cross-reference mappings
   - Establish document relationships
   - Build searchable metadata

3. **Extract Key Information**
   - Identify critical requirements
   - Extract business rules and logic
   - Note technical constraints
   - Catalog integration points
```

### Phase 3: AI Context Integration

#### Step 1: Context Preparation
```markdown
1. **Create Document Summaries**
   - Executive summaries for each major document
   - Key requirements and constraints
   - Critical business rules
   - Technical specifications overview

2. **Build Knowledge Graph**
   - Map relationships between requirements
   - Identify dependencies and constraints
   - Link business needs to technical solutions
   - Create traceability matrix

3. **Generate AI Context Files**
   - Create context files for AI consumption
   - Extract actionable requirements
   - Prepare specification templates
   - Build decision support information
```

#### Step 2: Integration with ClaudeCode Workflows
```markdown
1. **Update Project Configuration**
   - Modify claude.md with document references
   - Update plan.md with extracted requirements
   - Populate todo.md with identified tasks
   - Configure spec templates with requirements

2. **Create Workflow Triggers**
   - Link documents to specific workflows
   - Set up automated context loading
   - Configure decision support systems
   - Establish feedback loops
```

"Start a new ClaudeCode project based on the requirements documents in docs/requirements/. Create specifications for each major feature and generate an initial development plan."

"Integrate my existing business requirements and technical documentation into a ClaudeCode project structure. Analyze for gaps and suggest additional specifications needed."
```

#### Requirement Analysis and Specification Creation
```markdown
"Review the business requirements in docs/requirements/business/ and create detailed technical specifications in the specs/ directory for each major feature."

"Analyze the API documentation in docs/technical/api/ and generate corresponding implementation specifications with acceptance criteria."

"Extract user stories from the existing documentation and convert them into actionable development tasks with clear definitions of done."
```

#### Gap Analysis and Documentation Enhancement
```markdown
"Review all existing documentation in docs/ and identify missing requirements, specifications, or technical details needed for development."

"Analyze the legacy system documentation in docs/legacy/ and create migration specifications with detailed requirements and acceptance criteria."

"Compare the business requirements with the technical specifications and identify any gaps, conflicts, or missing integration points."
```

#### Context-Aware Development Planning
