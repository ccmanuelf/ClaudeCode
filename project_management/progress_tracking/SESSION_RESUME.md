# Session Resume Guide
**ClaudeCode Progress Continuity System**
Version: 1.0 | Last Updated: 2024-12-17

## üéØ CURRENT PROJECT STATUS

### **Active Project**: ClaudeCode Enhancement Implementation
- **Phase**: 1 - Foundation & Continuity  
- **Current Task**: P1.1.1 - Create progress state tracking files
- **Progress**: 75% complete
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS ‚ö°
- **Last Session**: 2024-12-17T00:00:00Z

### **What We Were Working On**
Creating the foundational progress tracking infrastructure for ClaudeCode to enable seamless session continuity across context windows and time gaps.

**Files Created This Session**:
- ‚úÖ `ClaudeCode/progress-state/MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- ‚úÖ `ClaudeCode/progress-state/PROGRESS_STATE.json`
- üîÑ `ClaudeCode/progress-state/SESSION_RESUME.md` (current file)

**Files Still Needed**:
- ‚è≥ `ClaudeCode/progress-state/RESUME_COMMANDS.md`
- ‚è≥ `ClaudeCode/progress-state/CHECKPOINT_SYSTEM.md`

### **Next Immediate Actions**
1. Complete remaining progress tracking files (30 minutes)
2. Implement basic resume command functionality (45 minutes)
3. Test the checkpoint save/restore mechanism (30 minutes)
4. Begin comprehensive README creation (2 hours)

## üìã RESUME COMMANDS

### **Primary Resume Command**
```bash
/resume_progress
```
**Purpose**: Restore full context and continue from last checkpoint  
**When to Use**: Starting any new session  
**Expected Response**: Full project status, current task details, next steps

### **Specific Task Resume**
```bash
/resume_progress P1.1.1
```
**Purpose**: Jump directly to a specific task  
**When to Use**: When you know exactly which task to continue  
**Expected Response**: Task-specific context and action plan

### **Quick Status Check**
```bash
/progress_status
```
**Purpose**: Get current status without full context restoration  
**When to Use**: Quick check on progress during active session  
**Expected Response**: Brief status summary and next actions

### **Emergency Recovery**
```bash
/recover_from_checkpoint CP001
```
**Purpose**: Restore from specific checkpoint when session is corrupted  
**When to Use**: When normal resume fails or context is lost  
**Expected Response**: Full state restoration from checkpoint

---

## üîÑ SESSION HANDOFF PROTOCOL

### **When Ending a Session**
Always run before closing:
```bash
/checkpoint_save "Brief description of current state"
```

### **When Starting a New Session**
Always run first:
```bash
/resume_progress
```

### **Context Window Approaching Limit**
When context is getting full:
```bash
/session_handoff
```
This will:
1. Save current progress
2. Create context summary
3. Provide instructions for next session

---

## üß† CONTEXT Reconstruction

### **Essential Information Always Available**
- **Current Phase & Task**: What specific work is active
- **Progress Percentage**: How much of current task is complete
- **Files Modified**: What has been changed in current session
- **Blockers**: Any issues preventing progress
- **Next Actions**: Specific steps to take immediately

### **Context Recovery Levels**

#### **Level 1: Quick Resume (< 5 minutes)**
- Load current task status
- Identify immediate next steps
- Confirm readiness to proceed

#### **Level 2: Full Context (5-15 minutes)**
- Review recent progress and decisions
- Understand broader project context
- Analyze dependencies and blockers
- Create detailed action plan

#### **Level 3: Deep Recovery (15-30 minutes)**
- Complete project history review
- Analyze all design decisions
- Validate current approach
- Rebuild comprehensive understanding

### **When Each Level is Needed**
- **Level 1**: Same day resume, short break
- **Level 2**: Next day resume, different session
- **Level 3**: Week+ gap, major context loss

---

## ‚ùó EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### **Stuck in Middle of Task**
**Situation**: Progress halted, unclear how to proceed  
**Action**: 
```bash
/analyze_blocker "Description of what you're stuck on"
```
**Response**: Analysis of issue, potential solutions, alternative approaches

### **Context Window Exceeded Mid-Task**
**Situation**: Hit token limit while working  
**Action**:
```bash
/emergency_handoff
```
**Response**: Immediate state save and handoff instructions

### **Lost Progress Data**
**Situation**: Progress files corrupted or lost  
**Action**:
```bash
/rebuild_progress_from_files
```
**Response**: Scan project files to reconstruct progress state

### **Conflicting Information**
**Situation**: Progress state doesn't match actual files  
**Action**:
```bash
/reconcile_progress_state
```
**Response**: Compare files vs. progress state, resolve conflicts

---

## üé¨ STANDARD SESSION STARTUP SEQUENCE

### **Every New Session Should Begin With:**

1. **Context Restoration**
   ```bash
   /resume_progress
   ```

2. **Validation Check**
   - Review current task details
   - Confirm understanding of next steps
   - Identify any new blockers or changes

3. **Readiness Confirmation**
   ```bash
   Ready to proceed with [TASK_ID]: [TASK_NAME]?
   Next action: [SPECIFIC_ACTION]
   Estimated time: [TIME_ESTIMATE]
   ```

4. **Begin Work**
   - Start with the specified next action
   - Update progress as work proceeds
   - Save checkpoints regularly

## üìä PROGRESS INDICATORS

### **Task Status Meanings**
- **‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Task fully implemented and tested
- **‚ö° IN PROGRESS**: Currently being worked on
- **üîÑ ACTIVE**: Started but paused, ready to resume
- **üìã PLANNED**: Defined and ready to start
- **‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED**: Waiting for dependencies or decisions
- **‚ùå CANCELLED**: No longer needed or deprioritized

### **Progress Percentages**
- **0-25%**: Planning and initial setup
- **26-50%**: Core implementation begun
- **51-75%**: Major functionality complete
- **76-99%**: Testing and refinement
- **100%**: Complete and validated

---

## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **"I don't remember what we were working on"**
**Solution**: Run `/resume_progress` for full context restoration

#### **"The progress file shows something different than what I see"**
**Solution**: Run `/reconcile_progress_state` to sync files with progress

#### **"I'm not sure if this task is complete"**
**Solution**: Check acceptance criteria in MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

#### **"The next step isn't clear"**
**Solution**: Review task dependencies and consult the master plan

#### **"Something changed since last session"**
**Solution**: Run `/validate_current_state` to check for external changes

---

## üí° BEST PRACTICES

### **Session Management**
1. Always start with `/resume_progress`
2. Save checkpoints every 30 minutes of active work
3. End sessions with `/checkpoint_save`
4. Document any blockers or decisions made

### **Progress Tracking**
1. Update progress percentages realistically
2. Note all files created or modified
3. Document any deviations from the plan
4. Record time estimates vs. actual time

### **Context Preservation**
1. Write clear, specific next actions
2. Document any assumptions or decisions
3. Note external dependencies or changes
4. Keep progress descriptions current
