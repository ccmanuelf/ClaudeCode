## Framework Prompt Categories

### ⚡️ Investigation
Prompts designed to uncover goals, motivations, and foundational understanding.

- "What’s the core problem you’re solving here?"  
- "Can you describe the desired outcome in your own words?"  
- "How will we know this solution is successful?"

### 🔭 Exploration
Used to uncover alternatives, trade-offs, and parallel ideas.

- "What other approaches or tools have you considered?"  
- "Are there potential edge cases or long-term implications we should explore?"  
- "What would happen if we inverted the current assumption?"

### 🎯 Action
Structured prompts to help move decisions forward and define next steps.

- "What’s the immediate next task we should focus on?"  
- "Is anything blocking you from starting right now?"  
- "Should we break this down into subtasks?"

### 🤔 Reflection
Used to promote critical thinking and post-action optimization.

- "What worked well and what could be improved?"  
- "Was anything unexpected during this process?"  
- "Would you take a different approach next time?"
