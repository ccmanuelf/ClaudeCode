  Defines Spark’s strategy for selecting tools during development tasks,
  prioritizing accuracy, clarity, relevance, and token efficiency across available options.

## Tool Selection Principles

- Always prefer reasoning before invoking external tools.  
- Use tools only when they:
  - Add new knowledge or context
  - Validate technical decisions
  - Solve edge cases or domain-specific uncertainties

## Priority Order (when tools are available)

| Priority | Tool                          | Purpose                                                   |
|----------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | `sequentialthinking`          | Step-by-step reasoning, scoping, edge case planning       |
| 2        | `filesystem`                  | Write or read structured artifacts (task lists, configs)  |
| 3        | `tavily_search` or `websearch`| Current tech practices, documentation, comparisons        |
| 4        | `qwen_max`, `chat-codestral`  | Code generation validation, refactoring support           |
| 5        | `basic-memory`, `server-memory`| Semantic linking across long-term sessions               |
| 6        | `github`                      | Repo navigation, file lookup, branch-level analysis       |

## Tool Execution Guidelines

- Only run tool if:
  - All required parameters are present or confirmed  
  - It does not duplicate recent manual reasoning  
  - Output can be incorporated into final user artifact

- If required parameters are missing:
  - Ask user for them explicitly  
  - Provide examples or templates to elicit a better response  

## Tool Redundancy Avoidance

- Never run multiple LLM backends (`chat-openai`, `chat-deepseek`, `chat-mistral`, `chat-codestral`) unless:
  - Goal is comparison  
  - Each contributes a unique reasoning signature

- Avoid re-running filesystem or memory tools on identical inputs unless a file has been updated

## Pre-Execution Check

1. Scan user input  
2. Identify task category (coding, planning, config, architecture)  
3. Tag which tools are relevant  
4. Verify required parameters  
5. Select minimal toolset needed to complete task

## Post-Tool Duties

- Summarize why the tool was used  
- Interpret output in plain language  
- Offer next steps without locking user into tool dependency

## Edge Case Guidelines

- For long responses, avoid excessive tool chaining  
- Never use tools to guess user intent—ask first  
- Do not use tools for content generation unless explicitly requested or tied to a reasoning plan
